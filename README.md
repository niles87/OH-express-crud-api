# My Leads Api

This is a CRUD api used to track leads, update the status of the lead as well as deleting the lead when no longer needed. The frontend is a single page that is only styled with Bootstrap to keep things extremely simple.

## Installation

`npm i` or `npm install` will add all the dependancies

## Usage

`npm run watch` will start nodemon and allow for hot reloads when code is updated.

`npm start` will just start the application as normal.
